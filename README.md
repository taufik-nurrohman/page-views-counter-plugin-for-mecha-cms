Page Views Counter Plugin for Mecha CMS
=======================================

> This plugin will count the number of your page views every time you visit the page. Only for articles and pages.

Upload the `page-views-counter` folder along with its contents through the plugin uploader. You need to compress the folder into a ZIP file to simplify the uploading process. After that, go to the plugin manager page and follow the instructions on the **About** tab.
